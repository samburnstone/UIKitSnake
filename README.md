UIKitSnake
==========

Snake game made using mostly UIKit components

Pixel art from: http://aquaw93.deviantart.com/art/mini-ice-creams-182529375 (thanks!)

# TODO

1.
Food respawn currently timer based (every 3 seconds)

Instead, item should spawn when another has been collected

2.
Only the head part of the snake is checked for collisions with food items.

All body parts should be checked for collision

3.
Only 2 generic food items

Special items with limited lifespan (extra points)

4.
Snake looks generic (and unsnakelike!)

Make it look more like a snake (distinguish head from tail).
Maybe add banding [snakeImg]
